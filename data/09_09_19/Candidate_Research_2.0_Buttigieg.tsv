Econ_4	Fiscal	The government should address reducing the national debt through higher taxes or reduced spending	5	He calls for investments in infrastructure and education to boost productivity. He adds that a lot of debt reduction “can happen on the revenue side where people are not paying their fair share.” He also mentions a financial transactions tax.	https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/02/20/buttigieg_generational_pain_awaits_if_debt_is_ignored_139517.html

Econ_6	Industry	The government should break up the mega-tech firms (Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon) into smaller competing firms	4	We’re going to need to empower the FTC to be able to intervene, including blocking or reversing mergers in cases where there’s anti-competitive behavior among tech companies even if it can’t directly be applied to pricing because you’re not seeing it in the form of changes to prices since the product’s free	https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512428/pete-buttigieg-facebook-google-amazon-apple-antitrust-ftc-break-up
Econ_7	Industry	I support a public single-payer healthcare system	4	Pete supports achieving Medicare for All through a pathway that helps improve people’s lives along the way while allowing the economy to adjust. He calls this “Medicare for All Who Want It.” This plan makes a Medicare-type public option available on the exchange and invites people to buy into it: if corporate insurers don’t lower costs to deliver something dramatically better than what is available today, competition will create the glide path toward Medicare for All.	https://peteforamerica.com/issues/
Econ_8	Industry	Private health insurance should be abolished in favor of a government-run plan	2	Pete can imagine an end-state where the private sector 'withers away' due to an inabilityt to compete with 'medicare for all that want it;' however, most likely, he sees the end state where Medicare is the 'center of gravity' and suplemental insurance is provided by the private sector	https://peteforamerica.com/issues/#Freedom

Econ_10	Labor	The government should require employers to pay men and women the same salary for the same job	4	The United States should pass a new law publicly reporting a simple annual statistic for every large company: for every dollar paid to men, how much less did women make? Companies that don’t hire, pay, and promote women fairly will have to explain themselves and change. It starts with transparency. And it is way past time to enact the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would make it more difficult for employers to hide unfair pay practices.	https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/military/defense-spending/
Econ_11	Labor	The government should institute policies that sreangthen and encourage labor unions	5	Pete believes that unions must have a powerful seat at the table — to stand up against unfair and abusive practices and to collaborate in improving work environments and productivity.	https://peteforamerica.com/issues/
Social_1	Education	Higher education should be tuition free (publically funded)	4	We will invest in college students’ futures by making public college tuition free for low-income students and ensuring the lowest-income students can cover living costs without taking on student debt through increased investments in the Pell Grant program	https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6188695/PFA-Douglass-Plan.pdf
Social_2	Education	The government should forgive outstanding student debt	4	We will cancel the debts of borrowers in low-quality, overwhelmingly for-profit programs beginning with those that failed federal “gainful employment” rules designed to ensure students receive an adequate return on their investments where the federal government should never have allowed students to enroll.	https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6188695/PFA-Douglass-Plan.pdf
Social_3	Gun Control	The government should ban all assault style weapons and high capacity magazines from public purchase	5	Pete believes to ban military-style assault weapons	https://peteforamerica.com/issues/

Social_5	Criminal Justice	Death penalty should be ended at state and federal levels	5	Abolish the death penalty	https://peteforamerica.com/issues/
Social_6	Criminal Justice	Government should allow clemency plans for non-violent drug offenders currently incarcerated	5	We will commute the sentences of people who are incarcerated in the federal system beyond what justice warrants by establishing an independent clemency commission that sits outside the Department of Justice	https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6188695/PFA-Douglass-Plan.pdf
Social_7	Criminal Justice	The government should take an active role to reduce police brutality, especially those driven by racial biases	5	Increase police accountability for misconduct and prevent discriminatory police practices	https://peteforamerica.com/issues/
Social_8	Criminal Justice	Marijuana should be legalized at the state and federal levels	5	Legalize marijuana and address the harmful effects of its criminalization	https://peteforamerica.com/issues/
Social_9	Church-State	I support the Equality Act (amending the Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, public accommodations, public education, federal funding, credit, and the jury system)	5	Pass the Equality Act	https://peteforamerica.com/issues/

Social_11	Democracy	Citizens united should be overturned	5	Overturn Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo, if necessary by constitutional amendment	https://peteforamerica.com/issues/
Foreign_1	Unilateralism	President should be required to come to Congress for an authorization of the use of military force (AUMF)	5	The time has come for Congress to repeal and replace that blank check on the use of force and ensure a robust debate on future operations	https://peteforamerica.com/national-security-for-a-new-era/
Foreign_2	Unilateralism	Israel meets international standards of human rights	1	The suffering of the Palestinian people–especially the humanitarian disaster in Gaza–has many authors, from the extremism of Hamas and inefficacy of the Palestinian Authority to the indifference of the international community and, yes, the policies of the current Israeli government.	https://peteforamerica.com/national-security-for-a-new-era/
Foreign_3	Interventionism	We should bring U.S. troops home from America's post-9/11 wars without delay	5	“The world needs an America free from entrapment in endless war and prepared to focus on future threats,” Buttigieg said. U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, for example, must come to an end, he said.	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-buttigieg/buttigieg-urges-end-to-endless-u-s-war-return-to-iran-climate-deals-idUSKCN1TC20K

Foreign_6	Hegemony	It is not ideal but in some cases necessary to use extreme interrogration techniques, especially for terrorist suspects	2	Regarding the CIA torture report released Tuesday, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg tweeted "The country I served is better than this." At the same time, he said he was “troubled” by Barack Obama’s clemency for Chelsea Manning (Manning publicly exposed U.S. war crimes, a misdeed for which she was imprisoned and tortured).	https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/all-about-pete
Foreign_7	Hegemony	US should actively prevent China's rise as a military super-power	5	Of course, we can cooperate with the Chinese on areas of mutual interest, from climate disruption, to combatting terrorism to international peacekeeping operations. But we also must be prepared to defend our values, interests, and relationships.	https://peteforamerica.com/national-security-for-a-new-era/
