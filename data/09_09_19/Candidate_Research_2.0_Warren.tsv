Econ_1	Trade	The government should increase tariffs on products imported into the country	5	Trade is good when it helps American workers and families — when it doesn’t, we need to change our approach. And unlike Trump, while I think tariffs are an important tool, they are not by themselves a long-term solution to our failed trade agenda and must be part of a broader strategy that this Administration clearly lacks.	https://medium.com/@teamwarren/trade-on-our-terms-ad861879feca
Econ_2	Fiscal	Current taxes on the rich are too low and should be increased	5	Warren's plan is to the proposal is to tax a family’s wealth above $50 million at 2 percent a year, with an additional surcharge of 1 percent on wealth over $1 billion.	https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/upshot/warren-wealth-tax.html
Econ_3	Fiscal	We should reduce taxes on the middle class	3	"Costs will go up for billionaires and go up for corporations," Warren said. "For middle-class families, costs — total costs — will go down." Under the current Medicare for All proposals, middle-class people would have no premiums, deductibles or copays, and save a lot of money on health care," he said. "Whether they would pay more or less on net would depend on which taxes go up to pay for the plan."	https://www.npr.org/2019/07/30/746805856/the-democratic-debate-over-medicare-for-all-and-middle-class-taxes-explained

Econ_7	Industry	I support a public single-payer healthcare system	5	Yes, I would support government-run insurance. Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. We need #MedicareForAll. 	https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1144054259547299850
Econ_8	Industry	Private health insurance should be abolished in favor of a government-run plan	5	Warren raised her hand when asked whether she would get rid of private coverage in favor of a government-run plan during the first Democratic debate.	https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/medicare-for-all/
Econ_9	Labor	The government should introduce $15/hr federally mandate minimum wage	5	We must raise the minimum wage to $15. Working families deserve living wages	https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1148749126257074177
Econ_10	Labor	The government should require employers to pay men and women the same salary for the same job	5	While white women make 77 cents for every dollar a white man makes, black women make 61 cents, and Latina women make just 53. Now Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has released a plan aimed at closing those gaps.	https://www.vox.com/2019/7/5/20683301/elizabeth-warren-wage-gap-gender-race-harris
Econ_11	Labor	The government should institute policies that sreangthen and encourage labor unions	5	The AFL-CIO's legislative scorecard says that, over her career, Warren has voted with unions 98 percent of the time	https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/warren-would-be-the-most-pro-union-nominee-in-generations

Social_2	Education	The government should forgive outstanding student debt	5	I’m calling for something truly transformational — the cancellation of up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans.	https://medium.com/@teamwarren/im-calling-for-something-truly-transformational-universal-free-public-college-and-cancellation-of-a246cd0f910f

Social_4	Gun Control	The government should introduce a gun buy-back program	3	No info	
Social_5	Criminal Justice	Death penalty should be ended at state and federal levels	5	Our criminal justice system has a long history of mistakes when it comes to capital punishment—especially when it comes to Black and Brown people. We cannot let a broken system decide the fate of incarcerated Americans. I oppose the death penalty.	https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1154436814146609154
Social_6	Criminal Justice	Government should allow clemency plans for non-violent drug offenders currently incarcerated	5	I’ll remove the clemency process from DOJ, instead empowering a clemency board to make recommendations directly to the White House. I’ll direct the board to identify broad classes of potentially-deserving individuals for review, including those who would have benefited from retroactivity under the First Step Act, individuals who are jailed under outdated or discriminatory drug laws, or those serving mandatory minimums that should be abolished.	https://medium.com/@teamwarren/rethinking-public-safety-to-reduce-mass-incarceration-and-strengthen-communities-90e8591c6255
Social_7	Criminal Justice	The government should take an active role to reduce police brutality, especially those driven by racial biases	5	I’ll end stop-and-frisk by directing the Justice Department to withhold federal funding from law enforcement agencies that continue to employ it and other similar practices, and I’ll work with Congress to pass legislation to prohibit profiling at all levels of law enforcement. Expand the responsible use of body cameras and protect citizen privacy. 	https://medium.com/@teamwarren/rethinking-public-safety-to-reduce-mass-incarceration-and-strengthen-communities-90e8591c6255
Social_8	Criminal Justice	Marijuana should be legalized at the state and federal levels	5	It starts with legalizing marijuana and erasing past convictions, and then eliminating the remaining disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentencing. 	https://medium.com/@teamwarren/rethinking-public-safety-to-reduce-mass-incarceration-and-strengthen-communities-90e8591c6255
Social_9	Church-State	I support the Equality Act (amending the Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, public accommodations, public education, federal funding, credit, and the jury system)	5	That reflects such positions as her cosponsorship of the Equality Act and other antidiscrimination bills, and her opposition to Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominees — Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — as well as other anti-LGBTQ Trump nominees.	https://www.advocate.com/politics/2019/1/03/elizabeth-warren-persists-supporting-lgbtq-rights
Social_10	Church-State	The government should provide all women free access to abortion facilities and cover costs of care	5	All women — no matter where they live, where they’re from, how much money they make, or the color of their skin — are entitled to access the high-quality, evidence-based reproductive health care that is envisioned by Roe.	https://medium.com/@teamwarren/congressional-action-to-protect-choice-aaf94ed25fb5
Social_11	Democracy	Citizens united should be overturned	5	Democracy for all amendment bill is co-sponsored by few 2020 presidential candidates including Senator Warren	https://www.newsweek.com/big-money-citizens-united-campaign-funding-1451687
Foreign_1	Unilateralism	President should be required to come to Congress for an authorization of the use of military force (AUMF)	5	Those who sign the letter pledge to “fight to reclaim Congress’s constitutional authority to conduct oversight of U.S. foreign policy and independently debate whether to authorize each new use of military force” and “act to bring the Forever War to a responsible and expedient conclusion.”	https://thehill.com/policy/defense/432670-sanders-ocasio-cortez-sponsoring-end-the-forever-war-pledge
Foreign_2	Unilateralism	Israel meets international standards of human rights	3	The current situation is not tenable.	https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/israel-human-rights-democratic-candidates.html
Foreign_3	Interventionism	We should bring U.S. troops home from America's post-9/11 wars without delay	5	“I think it is right to get our troops out of Syria ― and let me add, I think it’s right to get our troops out of Afghanistan,” Warren said.	https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/01/03/warren-backs-withdrawal-of-troops-from-syria-afghanistan/23633027/

Foreign_6	Hegemony	It is not ideal but in some cases necessary to use extreme interrogration techniques, especially for terrorist suspects	1	No matter how you dress it up, torture is torture and it is wrong. It is inhumane, it is ineffective and it is un-American	https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-delivers-floor-speech-opposing-gina-haspel-for-cia-director
Foreign_7	Hegemony	US should actively prevent China's rise as a military super-power	4	Whether our leaders recognize it or not, after years as the world’s lone superpower, the United States is entering a new period of competition. Democracy is running headlong into the ideologies of nationalism, authoritarianism, and corruption. China is on the rise, using its economic might to bludgeon its way onto the world stage and offering a model in which economic gains legitimize oppression.	https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-11-29/foreign-policy-all
Foreign_8	Hegemony	US and developing countries (China, India) should have same climate change standards despite the underlying different stages of development	1	the Warren campaign released its most comprehensive climate plan yet, a $2 trillion package that commits the federal government to spend $150 billion a year over the next decade on low-carbon technology, increases energy research funding tenfold and funds a $100 billion Green Marshall Plan to aid the poorer countries projected to suffer the worst as global temperatures rise. This is irrespective of what other countries do	https://www.yahoo.com/news/elizabeth-warren-climate-plan-133000864.html
