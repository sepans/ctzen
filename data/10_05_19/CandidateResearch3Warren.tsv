Econ_1	Trade	The government should increase tariffs on products imported into the country	3	Trade is good when it helps American workers and families — when it doesn’t, we need to change our approach. And unlike Trump, while I think tariffs are an important tool, they are not by themselves a long-term solution to our failed trade agenda and must be part of a broader strategy that this Administration clearly lacks.	https://medium.com/@teamwarren/trade-on-our-terms-ad861879feca
Econ_2	Fiscal	Current taxes on the rich are too low and should be increased	5	Warren's plan is to the proposal is to tax a family’s wealth above $50 million at 2 percent a year, with an additional surcharge of 1 percent on wealth over $1 billion.	https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/upshot/warren-wealth-tax.html
Econ_3	Fiscal	We should reduce taxes on the middle class	3	"Costs will go up for billionaires and go up for corporations," Warren said. "For middle-class families, costs — total costs — will go down." Under the current Medicare for All proposals, middle-class people would have no premiums, deductibles or copays, and save a lot of money on health care," he said. "Whether they would pay more or less on net would depend on which taxes go up to pay for the plan."	https://www.npr.org/2019/07/30/746805856/the-democratic-debate-over-medicare-for-all-and-middle-class-taxes-explained

Econ_5	Industry	The government should support (through grants, tax breaks, subsidies) the clean energy sector	5	I’m proud to be an original supporter of the Green New Deal. That’s why I’ve proposed a historic $2 trillion investment in researching, developing, and manufacturing clean energy technology here in America	https://medium.com/@teamwarren/accelerating-the-transition-to-clean-energy-46af492d8c57

Social_5	Criminal Justice	Death penalty should be ended at state and federal levels	5	Our criminal justice system has a long history of mistakes when it comes to capital punishment—especially when it comes to Black and Brown people. We cannot let a broken system decide the fate of incarcerated Americans. I oppose the death penalty.	https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1154436814146609154
Social_6	Criminal Justice	Government should allow clemency plans for non-violent drug offenders currently incarcerated	1	I’ll remove the clemency process from DOJ, instead empowering a clemency board to make recommendations directly to the White House. I’ll direct the board to identify broad classes of potentially-deserving individuals for review, including those who would have benefited from retroactivity under the First Step Act, individuals who are jailed under outdated or discriminatory drug laws, or those serving mandatory minimums that should be abolished.	https://medium.com/@teamwarren/rethinking-public-safety-to-reduce-mass-incarceration-and-strengthen-communities-90e8591c6255

Foreign_1	Unilateralism	President should be required to come to Congress for an authorization of the use of military force (AUMF)	5	Those who sign the letter pledge to “fight to reclaim Congress’s constitutional authority to conduct oversight of U.S. foreign policy and independently debate whether to authorize each new use of military force” and “act to bring the Forever War to a responsible and expedient conclusion.”	https://thehill.com/policy/defense/432670-sanders-ocasio-cortez-sponsoring-end-the-forever-war-pledge

Foreign_6	Hegemony	US and developing countries (China, India) should have same climate change standards despite the underlying different stages of development	1	the Warren campaign released its most comprehensive climate plan yet, a $2 trillion package that commits the federal government to spend $150 billion a year over the next decade on low-carbon technology, increases energy research funding tenfold and funds a $100 billion Green Marshall Plan to aid the poorer countries projected to suffer the worst as global temperatures rise. This is irrespective of what other countries do	https://www.yahoo.com/news/elizabeth-warren-climate-plan-133000864.html
